Just playing around a bit
Returning to an old highschool hobby I had, of coding for pre-FaceBook social media pages.  I used to accept lunch money to "decorate" peoples pages with backgrounds and effects.  I had compiled pages of code on a basic notepad, I never knew there was so much more beyond it, lol.
