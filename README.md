# hello-world

Just playing around a bit.

Returning to an old highschool hobby I had, of coding for pre-FaceBook social media pages.  I used to accept lunch money to "decorate" my classmates pages with backgrounds and effects.  I had compiled pages of code on a basic notepad, I had no idea at that age that what I was doing was an actual skill I could have developed into something so big.  So, here I am several years later, having some fun :-)
